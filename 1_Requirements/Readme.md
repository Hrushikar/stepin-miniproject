# Requirements

## Introduction:
- There are many situations in our life that include calculations that involve big numbers. There can also be matrix calculations, which are of large dimensions, thus being complicated to calculate.
- With this calculator utility, one can perform operations that are simple but involve large and real numbers, involve matrices, and trigonometric identities.


## Research:
Scientific calculators display large numbers in exponential forms if the calculations include large numbers, which are difficult to process for a common man. Reducing that complexity is necessary.

### Benefits:
- Make it easy and quicker for a common user to read and interpret the results of the calculations.
- Reduce the time taken by traditional calculators for calculations involving large numbers and matrix dimensions.

## Defining our System:
The application focuses on simple mathematical operations, matrices & trigonometric calculations.

### Simple mathematical operations:
